Setup:

Install i3 window manager - sudo apt-get install i3
Login to an LXQT session
Open the LXQT Session Settings
5. Change the Window Manager to i3 (/user/bin/i3)
6. Under 'LXQt Modules' Uncheck the 'Desktop' and 'Global Keyboard Shortcuts'
7. Close the LXQt Session Settings
Logout and Login to the LXQt session again
Press Enter when the little black i3 dialog appears
There should be both the LXQT Panel and the i3bar at the bottom. Leave the i3bar there in order to compare the desktop switcher behavior between i3 and LXQt-Panel

Steps To Reproduce Behavior:

Mess around and open windows from the Lubuntu Application Menu
Note how applications open in panels. It is not important to become familiar with resizing etc. for this setup. i3 usage
Open an application in the current desktop
Press: 'Mod Key' + '4'
Open an application in that desktop
Press: 'Mod Key' + '7'
Open an application in that desktop
Press: 'Mod Key' + '9'
. . . and so on. . .
('Mod' + 'Shift' + 'q' exits an application)

Present Behavior: (lxqt-panel desktop switcher only has partial functionality with i3-wm)
When creating new desktop workstations in i3, the numbers of the workstations in i3bar do not correlate to the workstation numbers in the LXQt Panel workstation switcher.

Desired Behavior:
When creating and switching workstations in i3, the LXQt workstation switcher plugin would behave as the i3bar does, displaying the numbers associated with specific workstations as they were opened.

*libi3ipc-glib for i3 Workstation *
That XFCE plugin uses a library, libi3ipc-glib, that may also be helpful for this feature.

To Reproduce:

View both i3bar and the LXQt Panel simultaneously on the same session.
Create multiple workstations in i3, such that their numbers on i3bar are not incremental. ie: 1, 4, 6, 9
Results on the LXQT Panel

While the i3bar shows proper non-incremental numbers, the LXQT Panel only shows incremental numbers up to the total number of i3 workstations.
The numbers in LXQT do not correspond to the number associated with the desktop/workstation in i3.
It will look something like below:

i3bar:--| 1 | 4 | 6 | 9 | (desired)

lxqt:----| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

lxqt workstations will alway be represented by incremental/consecutive integers, whereas i3 workstations are represented by non-consecutive integers, representing the number the user entered to represent the workstation.

The default in plugin-desktopswitch is to show the number of virtual desktop. But what i3 shows is the name of the desktop.

everything you need to do is change the "Desktop labels:" setting in Desktop switcher settings.
